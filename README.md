### COMP120 Tinkering Graphics Project - Contract #5
Made by Luke Day (dayluke)

## Instructions
Make sure python 3.7, and pygame, are installed.
Open the python file ("contract5.py") in PyCharm, and run the project.
The image file and python file should be located in the same folder.

## Choice of License
I chose the MIT License as I would like anyone to be able to view and use my code as they wish, e.g. making distributions.
